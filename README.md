# Object-Detection-for-Self-Driving-Cars
Implemented a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8, enhancing autonomous driving capabilities. Trained on a robust dataset to accurately identify and classify vehicles, pedestrians, and other critical elements, thus significantly improving situational awareness and safety in autonomous vehicle systems.
